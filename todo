RecipeBox
  RecipeTable
    RecipeRow
      IngredientsTable
      Options
  RecipeDialog


/ Minimal reperesentation of state as an object

{ showRecipeDialog: 'edit' / 'create' / false
, recipes:
  [
    { 
    , 
    }
  , {
    ,
    }
  ]
}



Somehow I need to put recipes in state 

Where is state?


In the future, create a function to abstract the craziness of reduce()
